# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-using-R
● We have a dataset related with direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution that was based on phone calls. The purpose of their campaign was to market term deposits towards different customers.
● Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (yes) or not (no) subscribed.
● The data under study here is called Bank Marketing Dataset (BMD) and he was found in the Machine Learning Repository (UCI). The data is public available in the url https://archive. ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#.

## Business Goal:
Improve marketing effectiveness by targeting the right customers in their next campaign.
